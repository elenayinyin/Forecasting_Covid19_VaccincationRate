# Forecasting_Covid19_VaccincationRate
**Objective:**
- Forecast vaccination rates using data science or machine learning algorithms in order to determine the impact of vaccination on our daily lives.
- Mainly compare the situation under Canada and India.
- Examine correlations between vaccination and new death rate to get insights on how healthcare system, government, and industry can tackle this growing problem through increased immunization.

**Attachments:**
- **Covid19-vaccination.csv:** Official daily data for 218 countries collated by the Our World in Data team. Obtained from the link: https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations
- **Complete_covid19_dataset.csv:** The complete official dataset.

**Process:**
- Clean up the missing dataset. Customize the data cleaning pipeline, examine the correlation matrix between the features, perform statistical tests to determine the similarity between their distributions, and then decide how to fill.
- Visualize how different regions/continents implement and polularize the vaccinations. Visualize how's the effectiveness over time regarding to daily vaccination among different countries.
- Select time-series ARIMA model by parameters estimation, diagnostic checking, and forecasting vaccination scenarios (best, base, worst) for Canada and India.
